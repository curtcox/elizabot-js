hello
I am feeling sad
My mother doesn't understand me
I have problems with my boss
Everyone hates me
I need help
I am worried about the future
I can't sleep at night
I want to be happy
My life is a mess
I remember being happy
I forget how to be happy
if only someone would help me
I dreamed of flying
perhaps I should give up
what is your name?
are you a computer?
I am tired
I don't like therapy
I feel alone
why can't I be normal?
everybody seems happier than me
always feeling this way
computers make me nervous
goodbye

hello
I am feeling sad
My mother doesn't understand me
I have problems with my boss
Everyone hates me
I need help
I am worried about the future
I can't sleep at night
I want to be happy
My life is a mess
I remember my childhood
I had a dream last night
I dreamed I was flying
I forget things easily
Perhaps I should see a doctor
I believe I am sick
Why can't I be normal?
I don't like myself
I feel anxious all the time
My friends think I'm strange
I want to change my life
If I could start over
I was different when I was younger
Always feeling alone
I am sorry for complaining
goodbye
